        </h2>
        <p>
          You are not buying an app. You are licensing an AI-powered infrastructure deployment built for performance, governed by contract, and enforced by design.
        </p>
        <p>
          Van Borg systems are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Business-critical frameworks with operational weight</li>
          <li>Embedded AI logic, not downloadable software</li>
          <li>Licensed modules with legal guardrails and activation rules</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          By engaging with Van Borg, you're entering into a commercial infrastructure agreement â€” not a product purchase. If you're not ready to treat automation like an asset, you're not ready for Van Borg.
